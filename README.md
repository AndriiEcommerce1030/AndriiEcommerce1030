## 👋 Hi, I'm **Andrii** — eCommerce Developer & Problem Solver

I’m passionate about building **fast, user-friendly, and revenue-driving online stores**.  
What motivates me most is **helping businesses grow**, improving their conversion rates, and creating seamless shopping experiences.

### 🌱 Outside of coding, I’m someone who:
- Enjoys learning new tech and improving workflows  
- Follows the latest trends in eCommerce & UX  
- Loves solving real business problems with clean engineering  
- Values long-term client relationships and clear communication  

I believe every store has its own unique story — and I love turning that story into a **high-performing digital product**.
